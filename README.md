# Scooter_Availability_Analysis

In this project we used Scooter Data to do Exploratory Data Analysis in order to improve overall transportation planning in Nashville TN

Our goal was to determine the ideal density of available scooters to:
* serve the transportation goals of Nashville
* discourage scooters piling up on sidewalks
* keep it economically viable for companies to operate equitably in the city of Nashville

## The following points were considered
1. reduce the number of people driving alone
2. 3 rides (of 3 meters or more) per day per scooter as baseline for ridership goals
3. original pilot program limited scooter density to 340 scooters per square mile

## The data
The data was provided by Metro Nashville (TN), Shared Urban Mobility Device (SUMD). The data provided was for the months of May, June, and July of 2019.

Per ordinance, the following were provided as a guidance:
* pubdatetime - date and time that the device was polled
* latitude - latitude location of device when polled
* longitude - longitude location of device when polled
* sumdid - unique identifier for the device
* sumdtype - one of two types (powered or standard)
* chargelevel - battery charge level of the device when polled
* sumdgroup - type of device (scooter or bicycle)
* costpermin - the cost per minute of device use
* companyname - the company that owns the device
